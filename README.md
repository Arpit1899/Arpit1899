**About me**

I am a computer science student with a passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning. I have professional experience as a full stack developer and have worked on a variety of projects, including the development of a successful online store and the creation of automated CI/CD pipelines. I have strong programming skills in languages such as Python, C, and JavaScript, and am proficient in frameworks such as React and Node.js. In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal projects related to game AI and building low-level browser applications. I am a Dean's List recipient and have received the A. J. Drexel Scholarship for my academic achievements.
